# Native Linux compiler

`linux.sotlas` is a Linux x86-64 compiler driver written in Sotlas. It reads
source files, runs the production frontend and Target IR lowerer, writes ELF
objects and links executable images. File operations use kernel syscalls;
the generated compiler has no ELF interpreter or dynamic C runtime.

## Initial seed

Build the current hosted Stage 1 producer once, then use its native object
writer and linker to create the seed:

```sh
./build/sotlas_stage1 --compile-obj \
  bootstrap/sotlas/native_driver/linux.sotlas build/linux_driver.o
./build/sotlas_stage1 --link-exe \
  build/linux_driver.o build/sotlas-native sotlas_linux_main
```

The initial producer still uses the hosted bootstrap. The resulting seed's
compilation and self-build paths do not invoke Python, Clang, a C emitter or
an external linker.

## Compile files

```sh
./build/sotlas-native input.sotlas output
./build/sotlas-native input.sotlas output.o --object
./output
```

Executable input uses `main_entry() -> u32`. `--compiler` selects the checked
`sotlas_linux_main(argc: u64, argv: *const *const u8) -> u32` process ABI, which
receives the kernel's actual argument vector. Unknown options are rejected.

Input must be smaller than 1 MiB. Source storage reserves another MiB for
synthetic symbols. Compiler tables are bounded and exhausted buffers fail
closed. Output is created only after frontend, lowering and linking succeed;
an I/O failure during writing can leave a partial file. Newly created outputs
use mode 0755; existing files retain their permissions.

## Native self-build

The self-build input concatenates these production sources in order:

1. `token`, `ast`, `lexer`, `parser`, `sema`
2. `backend/target_ir`, `backend/lower_scalar`, `backend/x86_64_scalar`
3. `native_driver/linux.sotlas`

Remove their top-level import declarations after concatenation: every dependency
is already included once. The current file driver explicitly rejects imports
instead of silently pretending to resolve them. This merged source is a build
input; it is not a second implementation of the compiler.

```sh
./build/sotlas-native compiler_merged.sotlas build/stage2 --compiler
./build/stage2 compiler_merged.sotlas build/stage3 --compiler
cmp build/stage2 build/stage3
```

`tests/test_sotlas_native_linux_driver.py` creates this merged input,
compares native and hosted-producer objects, requires Stage 2 and Stage 3 to be
byte-for-byte identical, and executes a program compiled by Stage 3. These
execution tests run with `PATH` pointing to an empty directory. Windows and
macOS compile and link the seed as a cross-target ELF artifact; Linux x86-64
executes the generation chain. WSL can execute the same local artifacts.

This closes a native self-build for the current compiler-source subset. Native
module/project loading, full language parity, installed distribution and
Windows/macOS native drivers remain open.

## Kernel interface

Reserved bodyless scalar declarations named `sotlas_linux_read`,
`sotlas_linux_write`, `sotlas_linux_open` and `sotlas_linux_close` lower to a
validated `SystemOp`. The existing C ABI syntax describes the scalar boundary;
these calls do not bind libc symbols. The backend emits Linux x86-64 syscalls
0, 1, 2 and 3 directly and preserves negative kernel error returns as `i64`.
Other declarations continue to use ordinary external-call linking. The Linux
process-entry ABI has a dedicated ELF note flag; it cannot be selected by
supplying arbitrary constant entry arguments or a freestanding target.
