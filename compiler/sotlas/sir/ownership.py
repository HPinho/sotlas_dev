"""Backend-neutral lowering of shared ownership facts into canonical SIR ops.

This bridge deliberately does not place instructions into CFG blocks yet.
OwnershipTrace currently aggregates some path cleanups without basic-block
identity, so pretending exact CFG placement would be unsound. The plan keeps
semantic ARC operations explicit until production SIR lowering owns that step.
