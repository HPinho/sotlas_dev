# Native frontend and ownership closure

Repository: [HPinho/sotlas_dev](https://github.com/HPinho/sotlas_dev).

This checklist tracks migration of the contracted canonical language into the
Sotlas-written compiler. A working bootstrap profile does not establish full
language parity. Parent items stay open until every contracted form has native
positive, negative and execution coverage. Subitems record smaller validated
contracts. Local validation must pass CI before being called certified.

## Frontend parity

- [ ] Migrate all acceptance and rejection rules still implemented by the Python frontend.
- [ ] Complete native typed AST representation for the remaining contracted features.
- [ ] Preserve types, ownership, states, effects, contracts and source positions through the backend.
- [ ] Complete symbol, namespace, visibility and import-alias resolution.
- [ ] Complete package and module dependency resolution.
- [ ] Compile modules separately rather than combining their source streams.
- [ ] Complete contracted type inference and coercions.
- [ ] Complete methods, receivers and calls outside the current native profile.
- [ ] Migrate generic features accepted by the canonical frontend.
- [ ] Implement payload enums and their native layout.
- [ ] Implement contracted `match` and selection forms with coverage checking.
- [ ] Complete general arrays, slices, indexing and slicing.
- [ ] Implement string and slice values beyond the current literal forms.
- [ ] Complete conditional expressions and remaining control-flow forms.
- [ ] Migrate canonical error handling and propagation.
- [ ] Complete constant-expression evaluation.
- [ ] Implement module constants with floats and other contracted types.
  - [x] Lower typed integer, Boolean, f32 and f64 literal constants, including unary-negative literals.
  - [x] Check unused constants with the same type and range rules as expressions.
  - [x] Restore temporary IR arena counts and value identities after declaration validation.
  - [ ] Evaluate general constant expressions and support other contracted constant types.
- [ ] Implement nonzero static initializers.
- [ ] Expand numeric literals, including scientific notation and decimals outside current bounds.
- [ ] Complete overflow, promotion and numeric-conversion rules for every contracted backend.
- [ ] Match canonical diagnostics: file, line, column, cause and context.
  - [x] Native file drivers report the input path, line, column and compiler phase.
  - [x] Single-file diagnostics include a bounded source excerpt and caret.
  - [x] Reserved function/local binders report an expected identifier at the offending token.
  - [x] Native `check` and `compile` report the same syntax errors and preserve existing output on failure.
  - [ ] Map combined project positions back to the original module and file.
  - [ ] Complete detailed semantic causes, diagnostic context and canonical error parity.

## Ownership, states, effects and cleanup

- [ ] Migrate canonical ownership analysis into Sotlas.
- [ ] Preserve all ownership domains in native IR.
- [ ] Implement `sole`/`exclusive`, moves and use-after-move checking in the native path.
- [ ] Implement ownership merges and `MAYBE_MOVED` in the CFG.
- [ ] Implement transfers through calls, returns, fields and payloads.
- [ ] Implement `shared`, aliases and reference accounts.
- [ ] Implement retain, release, destroy and drop glue in Sotlas.
- [ ] Implement `region`, lifetimes and escape validation.
- [ ] Implement `whisper`, reference validity and weak invalidation.
- [ ] Implement `direct`, alias graphs, forwarding and no-escape checking.
- [ ] Implement `island` isolation rules.
- [ ] Implement contracted `handover` and `quarantine` transitions.
- [ ] Implement native `device` and `external` contracts.
- [ ] Integrate ownership with bindings, arrays, aggregates, globals and calls.
- [ ] Guarantee exactly-once destruction on every accepted path.
- [ ] Complete cleanup on branches, loops, early returns and failures.
- [ ] Complete `defer`, LIFO execution and cleanup interaction.
- [ ] Migrate effect analysis and propagation.
- [ ] Migrate `unsafe`, target-capability and foreign-boundary validation.
- [ ] Migrate contracted state machines, transitions, refinements and coverage checks.
- [ ] Migrate contracts, preconditions, postconditions and executable guards.
- [ ] Replace semantic operations without runtime behavior with implementation or explicit rejection across the complete native profile.
  - [x] The owned x86-64 object writer rejects all eleven reserved semantic runtime opcodes before object emission.
  - [x] Backend-neutral IR can preserve these operations; unsupported execution never turns them into no-ops.
  - [x] Rejection resets output length, preserves IR, and leaves the output buffer unchanged.
  - [ ] Implement the corresponding ownership/state/cleanup runtime operations and their complete source-level diagnostics.

## New acceptance evidence

| Contract | Gate |
|---|---|
| Reserved semantic opcodes: neutral validation, native rejection and untouched output | `tests/test_sotlas_native_frontend_closure.py::test_semantic_runtime_markers_are_preserved_but_never_emitted_as_noops` |
| Float/Boolean/signed-minimum module constants and native/C11 result comparison | `tests/test_sotlas_native_frontend_closure.py::test_typed_module_constants_include_float_bool_and_signed_minimum` |
| Invalid unused constants rejected before output | `tests/test_sotlas_native_frontend_closure.py::test_invalid_unused_constants_fail_closed` |
| Unused constants do not leak temporary literal IR | `tests/test_sotlas_native_frontend_closure.py::test_unused_constants_do_not_leak_literal_ir_into_functions` |
| Native file diagnostics and check/compile consistency | `test_native_diagnostics_preserve_path_position_phase_and_context` in the Linux, Windows and Darwin driver suites |

These gates build the current sources through the strict public Stage-0
frontend in a fresh directory. They do not select a cached Stage-1 executable.
Stage 0 remains necessary to produce the initial test seed; execution and
native generation gates use the Sotlas-owned compiler afterward.

Local results: all four frontend-closure tests passed on Windows and Linux
(WSL), and on Windows Python 3.10.11. The combined Windows driver/frontend
run passed 15 tests. Linux diagnostics, original-module generation identity
and the floating-point workload passed three additional execution gates.
The C11 regression job passed 707 tests. The complete Windows regression
suite passed 2,761 tests with 65 platform/tool skips. Intel macOS execution remains a CI
gate; a Windows cross-build does not substitute for that execution evidence.

## Remaining limits

Literal module constants retain the native numeric bounds and 64-declaration
limit. General constant expressions remain rejected. Diagnostics display at
most 160 source bytes; combined project input still uses `<native-project>`
and combined-stream positions. Semantic opcode rejection protects users from
silently omitted behavior; it does not implement ARC, lifetimes or cleanup.

The broader items above remain open. Neither this checklist nor native compiler
fixed-point evidence authorizes deleting the Python reference implementation
or C bootstrap before their contracted features have native replacements.
